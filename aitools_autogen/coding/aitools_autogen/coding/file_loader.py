# To begin implementing the described system, let's start with the foundational components: the `File Loader`, `Logger`, and `Configuration Manager`. These components are essential for loading files, logging activities, and managing user configurations, respectively.

### File Loader

# The `File Loader` is responsible for loading Python files from specified directories or files for analysis. It will filter out non-Python files and optionally exclude certain directories or files based on the configuration.
